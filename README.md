# Hierarchical Spatial-Frequency Fusion with Derived Features Branch for Camouflage Object Detection
## Overall 
In this paper, we propose HiSFFNet for camouflaged object detection, effectively addressing the challenges of high object-background similarity and boundary ambiguity through the integration of the Auxiliary Input Generation Module (AIGM) with its derived feature branch, the Hierarchical Guided Fusion Module (HGFM), and the Multi-scale Spatial-Frequency Deformable convolution module (MSFD). The core of HiSFFNet lies in the synergy of a "primary + derived" dual-branch feature encoder. The AIGM generates diverse input modalities to capture complementary information, enhancing object representation. The HGFM facilitates hierarchical cross-branch interactions to guide the intensity distribution of object pixels in the primary branch, establishing semantic connections across feature levels. Subsequently, in a multi-stage decoding pipeline, the original input is fused in a block-wise intra-group manner to supplement fine-grained intra-object details in the primary branch. The MSFD leverages multi-scale deformable convolutions and frequency fusion to capture edge contours, reduce uncertainty in boundary predictions, and filter spectral information from highly similar backgrounds, thereby improving segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that HiSFFNet outperforms existing methods in camouflaged object detection and exhibits strong generalization capabilities across related tasks with similar characteristics.
